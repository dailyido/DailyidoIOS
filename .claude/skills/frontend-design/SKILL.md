# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that don't look like "AI slop."

## Design Philosophy

Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is **intentionality, not intensity**.

Before writing code, establish:
1. **The problem** — What is the interface trying to accomplish?
2. **The tone** — Minimalist? Maximalist? Retro? Organic? Corporate? Playful?
3. **Technical constraints** — Framework, performance requirements, accessibility needs
4. **The memorable detail** — What single element will make this design unforgettable?

## Avoid Generic AI Aesthetics

Common clichés to avoid:
- Generic font stacks (Inter, system-ui as the only choice)
- Predictable purple/blue gradients
- Cookie-cutter layouts with no character
- Overused component patterns without context-specific styling
- Scattered micro-interactions that feel arbitrary

## Aesthetic Focus Areas

### Typography
- Pair distinctive display fonts with readable body fonts
- Use font size contrast dramatically
- Consider custom letter-spacing and line-height for headings

### Color Systems
- Build cohesive palettes using CSS variables
- Use a dominant color with sharp accents
- Consider unexpected color combinations that fit the brand

### Animation & Motion
- Focus on high-impact moments (page transitions, key interactions)
- Use spring physics for organic feel
- Animate with purpose, not decoration

### Spatial Composition
- Break the grid intentionally
- Use asymmetry and overlap
- Create visual hierarchy through whitespace

### Visual Details
- Atmospheric backgrounds (gradients, textures, patterns)
- Creative borders and shadows
- Micro-details that reward close inspection

## Implementation Standards

Generate working, production-grade code:
- Use HTML/CSS/JS, React, SwiftUI, or the appropriate framework
- Code should be visually striking AND functionally complete
- Every design choice should be intentional
- Match code complexity to design complexity

## Matching Complexity to Vision

**Maximalist designs** warrant:
- Multiple animation libraries
- Complex gradient systems
- Layered visual effects
- Rich interaction patterns

**Minimalist designs** demand:
- Precise typography
- Perfect spacing
- Subtle, refined interactions
- Restraint in every choice

The elegance comes from executing the vision well.
